<h1>Memory</h1>
<p>A 9 year-old boy presents with a chief complaint of subacute memory deficits. In particular, the family explains that for, approximately, the last 2 weeks, he
 has not been himself, his behavior is abnormal and he tends to forget things.
 <br> 
 <br>
 With a chief complaint of <b>subacute memory deficits and subacute personality change</b>, let's think about the potential etiologies within the major etiological categories: 
 <br>
 -Traumatic 
 <br>
 -Vascular
 <br>
 -Epileptic
 <br>
 -CSF circulation
 <br>
 -Toxic/metabolic
 <br>
 -Infectious
 <br>
 -Inflammatory
 <br>
 -Neoplastic
 <br>
 -Degenerative
 <br>
 -Psychogenic
</p>

<h1>Memory 1</h1>
<p><a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25929634/'>The patient</a> has been complaining about mild, diffuse headaches for approximately 2 weeks. The memory deficits are described as asking the same questions over
 and over again as if he forgot what was just explained to him. His personality change is vaguely described as "not being himself" and behaving in a
 socially outgoing manner when, at baseline, he tends to be shy. During hospital admission, he presented
 several paroxysmal episodes of oromotor sensory symptoms in the perioral region with altered awareness which lasted 30-90 seconds each.
 Shortly after admission, he developed weakness in right lower extremity which made walking difficult. 
<br>
<br>
Diagnosed as having a Hodgkin lymphoma 3 months ago on adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine.
 <br>
 <br>
 Normal brain MRI.
 <br>
 Normal CSF including negative HSV.
 <br>
 Normal EEG.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Insomnia and visual hallucinations.
 <br>
Repeat brain MRI at 19 days after onset <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25929634/'>in Figure 1 here</a>.
 <br>
Repeat EEG at 19 days after onset showed diffuse slowing with no epileptiform discharges.
 <br>
Repeat CSF at 19 days after onset was normal (oligoclonal bands were not done).
<br>
Anti-NMDA antibodies in serum were negative.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Treatment with IV methylprednisolone and IVIG not successful. Progressive weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and death 30 days after onset.

<h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p><b>Limbic encephalitis in children is rare, very rare. A study from 12 hospitals in 4 European countries for 3 years <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20959359/'>found a total of 10 patients with pediatric limbic encephalitis</a>. As study on anti-Hu antibodies from the centralized laboratory in France for 11 years <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23658383/'>found 243 cases in adults and 8 cases in children</a>.";
<br>
<br>
In children, only a minority of limbic encephalitis are paraneoplastic. However, a neoplastic screening should be conducted.
<br>
<br>
Viruses like HHV6 can potentially cause a direct acute infection of the limbic area, an acute parainfectious immune reaction, or a slow progressive infection/inflammation process and it is not clear which one(s) is the cause for HHV6 limbic encephalitis. Maybe a combination of these mechanisms.
<br>
<br>
The clinical presentation of limbic encephalitis can be very unusual <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12486279/'>very unusual</a>.
<br>
<br>
Perseveration, inattention, executive function, planning, and visuospatial functions can be easily tested at bedside. 
<br>
<br>
There are many unknowns in pediatric limbic encephalitis
