<p>Apart from the etiologies we reviewed in question 2, remember that ECMO (apart from all the benefits it provides) is our stroke production machine: it may facilitate cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac thrombi,
 it may damage large and small vessels (because of abrupt changes in blood pressure), it may cause both episodes of hypercoagulability, and
 hypocoagulability, and it might facilitate infections across the whole cardiovascular system/ECMO circuit.<br>It is not surprising that stroke
 occurs in approximately 10-60% of pediatric patients on ECMO as shown in <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22421589/'>this</a> and <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24189317/'>this</a> study.
 Variability in the proportion of patients with stroke after ECMO depends on ECMO duration and neuroimaging studies and probably many more patients have subclinical strokes.</p>

<p>Perinatal stroke is a devastating condition associated with serious sequelae in most patients. After a perinatal stroke, expected outcomes are:
<br>
&ensp; cerebral palsy/motor deficits: 30-50%
<br>
&ensp; cognitive deficits: 50-60%
<br>
&ensp; epilepsy: 15-55%
<br>
<br>
Stroke in non-neonates has somewhat better outcomes, but not much better with only approximately 
 <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10830198/'>one third having no deficits</a> and
 approximately two thirds having a variable combination of motor, cognitive, and behavioral deficits.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p><b>After reading this post, you have reviewed the main concepts in pediatric stroke.</b></p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b>Epidemiology:<br>Pediatric stroke has an incidence of approximately 4-6/100,000, which is similar to the incidence of rolandic epilepsy.
 Pediatric stroke in non-neonates is slightly less frequent with an incidence of 2-4/100,000 (still approximately the same incidence
 as rolandic epilepsy). In contrast, perinatal stroke has a much higher incidence of 29-50/100,000, which is slightly higher than the
 incidence of stroke in adults 20-44 years of age and approximately 2-4 times lower than the incidence of stroke in adults 45-64 years
 of age. You can remember it as neonates having the incidence of stroke of roughly 50 year-old adults.</b></p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b>Etiology:<br>Causes of pediatric stroke are heterogeneous and can be classified by origin:
<br>
 Heart: Endocarditis. Congenital heart disease. Valvulopathy. Arrhythmia. Cardiomyopathy.
<br>
 Blood vessels: Vasculitis. Post-varicella arteriopathy. Moyamoya disease. Focal arteriopathy of childhood. Takayasu arteritis. 
<br>
 Blood/coagulation disorders: Antiphospholipid antibodies. Sickle cell disease. Inherited prothrombotic and lipid abnormalities. Lymphoproliferative disorders.
<br>
 Other: Trauma. Infection. Cancer. Toxins. Surgery. Metabolic disorders (hyperhomocysteinemia, congenital disorders of glycosilation).
<br>
 ECMO combines multiple potential mechanisms for causing stroke including thrombi from heart and large vessels, fluctuations in blood pressure, iatrogenic coagulation
 disorders, and the potential for disection, infection, and surgery. Therefore, 10-60% of pediatric patients on ECMO are found to have a stroke.
</b></p>


<br>
<br>

<p><b>Types of stroke:<br>Among ischemic stroke, arterial ischemic stroke represents approximately 80% and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis approximately 20% of cases.<br>
Among hemorrhagic stroke, intracerebral stroke is 2-3 times more frequent than subarachnoid hemorrhage.
</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Clinical presentation:<br>Stroke in children presents with the typical symptoms you expect in a stroke (hemiplegia, sensory loss, aphasia, hemianopia),
 but also with symptoms which may be difficult to attribute to a stroke (dystonia, headache, seizures). A particularly difficult situation occurs with the
 patient presenting with first time seizure with post-ictal paresis (and probably with altered mental status): is there a stroke as an etiology? Fortunately,
 stroke is a rare cause of new-onset seizures in children and typically there are other focal neurological signs.<br>Keep stroke in your differential diagnosis
 for acute/subacute presentations, but stroke is rare in non-neonate children without risk factors.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Outcome:<br>Pediatric stroke is associated with serious sequelae including motor deficits, epilepsy, cognitive deficits, and behavioral disorders. Only
 a minority of children with pediatric stroke (one third or less) remain with no serious sequelae. Remember that when informing families.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Treatment:<br>How to manage pediatric stroke is an area of active research. The relative rarity of pediatric stroke and the marked delays to diagnosis (even
 in large pediatric stroke centers) makes any study challenging. Although evidence is limited, if children are diagnosed before 4.5 hours, thrombolisis
 might be a reasonable option in children at least 2 years of age with PedNIHSS>=4 and <=24, with proven infarct and arterial occlusion on neuroimaging
 and no contraindications. Arterial thrombectomy is an option for children with large vessel occlussion. For patients with stroke in the context of
 sickle cell disease, exchange transfusion is a very reasonable treatment.</b></p>
