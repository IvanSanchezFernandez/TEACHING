<h1>Dystonia</h1>
<p>In this post you will learn the main features of dystonia.</p>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2>Identify the movement disorder</h2>
<p>In most areas of Neurology the first step is to localize the symptom in the central nervous system. In movement disorders you have to move a step
 back and first recognize and name the symptom: how do you call the abnormal movements of the patient?</p>


<br>
<br>


<form id="question1" name="question1">
<p><b>Q1. A first approach to classification of movement disorders is to put them in the category of "too much movement" (or movements which should not be there),
 "too little movement" (or movements which should be there, but are not), or "uncoordinated movement" (movements present, but dysorganized performance).
 Drag and drop the concepts into their corresponding category.</b>

<p>What about treatment? Treatment of dystonia is symptomatic in most patients.
<br>
<br>
First treatment: L-dopa/carbidopa. Always worth a try. If it is dopa-responsive dystonia you are going to diagnose and cure the disease. If not, many
 other forms of dystonia partially respond to L-dopa. Always try.
<br>
<br>
Symptomatic treatments: Trihexyphenidyl. Baclofen. Botulinum toxin.
<br>
<br>
Other less established symptomatic treatments: Clonazepam. Carbamazepine. Dopamine antagonists. Dopamine depletors.
<br>
<br>
Neurosurgery: For example, deep brain stimulation of the pallidus interna.

<h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p><b>After reading this post, you have reviewed the main concepts in dystonia.</b></p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b>You can classify and name the main symptoms in movement disorders. Importantly, you have a visual idea of how they look like.</b></p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b>Dystonia is a sustained contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles leading to abnormal twisting postures. You now know that dystonia
 can have unusual features which made doctors in the past believe it was of psychogenic origin: sensory trick, overflow, and task-specific symptoms.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>The main dystonias you should be aware of in children are: DYT1 (Jewish ancestry, evolution from one foot to whole body within 5 years),
 DYT5 (evolution from one foot to the whole body, but diurnal variation with worse symptoms at night), and 
 DYT11 (upper body involvement, myoclonus more prominent than dystonia, psychiatric history). All three of DYT1, DYT5, and DYT11
 are autosomal dominant.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Treatment of pediatric dystonia should always include a trial of L-dopa (DYT5 responds to it and others might respond partially).
 Symptomatic treatment includes trihexyphenidyl, baclofen, and botulinum toxin. In well-selected patients, <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fng.3740/MediaObjects/41588_2017_BFng3740_MOESM214_ESM.mpg'>neurosurgery can be life-changing</a>.</b></p>
