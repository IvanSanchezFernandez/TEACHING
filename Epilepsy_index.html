<h1>Epilepsy for developmental and behavioral pediatricians</h1>
<p>In this post you will learn the main features of epilepsy and how it affects development and behavior.</p>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p><b>Seizures do not necessarily mean epilepsy.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<form id="question1" name="question1">
<p><b>Q1. A 14 year-old adolescent comes to your clinic because, just for fun, he likes to run toward the wall and hit his head hard against the wall.
 Each time he hits his head on the wall he has a seizure. Seizures have never occurred out of that context. The next best step in avoiding new seizures is:</b></p>
<br>
<input type="radio" id="q1" name="question" value="a"> Start seizure medications. He is having seizures, therefore, he needs an antiseizure medication<br>
<input type="radio" id="q1" name="question" value="b"> Stop hitting his head against the wall. These are provoked seizures and they will stop after the abnormal stimulus is stopped. No antiseizure medication is needed<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>The key concept here is that provoked seizures occur in a <b>normal brain</b>, but unprovoked seizures occur in an <b>abnormal brain, a brain with a predisposition to have more seizures</b>.
 Remember, even if your brain is completely normal, if you hit your head hard enough against the wall you will have a seizure, if you take enough cocaine, you will have a seizure, and so on.
 You do not need antiseizure medications, you should just stop being exposed to these abnormal stimuli and your seizures will go away (obviously, if you do those things long enough
 your brain may be so abnormal that you may develop unprovoked seizures, but for now we are only considering the situation where the insults occur in the short term and you only have provoked seizures).</p>


<br>

<form id="question2" name="question2">
<p><b>Q2. True or false? Provoked seizures cannot make a diagnosis of epilepsy, no matter how many times they occur.</b></p>

<p>What is epilepsy then? Epilepsy (loosely defined) is a disease of the brain in which there is a chronic predisposition to have unprovoked seizures.
 Of course, the not loosely defined version is slightly more complicated. <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24730690/'>The current official definition of epilepsy is here</a>.</p>

<p>Taking a seizure history takes time. In general, it is best to just describe how was the event. If there is a video of the event that is even better.</p>

<p><b>Always describe the seizure in detail.</b> If you want, you can also try to classify it using the most recent classification of
 <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28276060/'>seizure types</a> and
 <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28276062/'>epilepsy syndromes</a>, but that is not
 crucial if you are not an epileptologist.</p>


<br>
<br>


<p>Once you understood these very simple concepts, the evaluation of any type of seizures becomes straightforward:
 if you have a patient with staring spells, <b>take a detailed description of the events</b> (when they happen, how long they last,
 triggers if any, ability to respond during the event, etc.). With that information, refer to pediatric neurology. They
 will decide what is the next step (if any).</p>


<br>
<br>


<p>What if your patient has other types of seizures?: <b>take a detailed description of the events</b> (when they happen, how long they last,
 triggers if any, ability to respond during the event, description of the movements if any, etc.). With that information, refer to pediatric neurology. They
 will decide what is the next step (if any).</p>

<p><b>Can epilepsies cause developmental regression?</b> Glad you asked! Seizures, antiseizure medications, and epileptiform discharges can cause cognitive problems.
<br>
<br>
Frequent seizures make it difficult for the child to learn (both because of missing school and because of the impact of seizures on the brain).
<br>
<br>
Phenobarbital causes some impairment in all aspects of cognition. Topiramate causes some language impairment. Levetiracetam frequently causes behavioral dysregulation.
<br>
<br>
Interictal epileptiform discharges can cause cognitive regression. Continuous spikes and waves during sleep is an epileptic encephalopathy in which there is
 cognitive regression because epileptiform activity dysrupts sleep. Landau-Kleffner syndrome causes language regression because epileptiform activity
 causes dysruption of temporal lobe function especially during sleep. Read more about that <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23127259/'>here</a>.
 Then, should epileptiform discharges be treated? Well, <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26293670/'>it is complicated</a>.</p>


<br>
<br>


<p>Treatment for ADHD, depression, or anxiety should not be modified because the patient has epilepsy or because the patient is on antiseizure medications
 unless there are specific contraindications. Some SSRIs reduce seizure threshold, but generally a patient with epilepsy will not have more seizures because of that
 if they take their antiseizure medications. When in doubt, talk to the pediatric neurologist, but in general, you should not change your behavioral medications
 because the patient has epilepsy or because the patient is on antiseizure medications.</p>


<br>
<br>


<p><a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33842079/'>One in three people with epilepsy have at least a psychiatric diagnosis during their lifetime</a>
 and the presence of these psychiatric problems is a bad prognostic sign. Screen for psychiatric diagnoses in people with epilepsy.</p>

<h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p><b>After reading this post, you have reviewed the main concepts in epilepsy.</b></p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b>Describe the seizure. Describe the seizure. Always describe the seizure. The more detail the better. If there is a video that is ideal.
 Classifying the seizure is less important than describing the seizure. Take a good history.</b></p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b>Epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis. Take a good history. If you are not a neurologist, you do not have to make the decision to classify an event as a seizure or a clinical
 presentation as epilepsy, or to decide whether the patient needs antiseizure medications, but you definitively are responsible for taking a good history and
 obtain a proper description of the events.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Make the world a better place: erradicate 'seizure disorder' and other aberrant terminology from medicine.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>EEGs typically help in the field of epilepsy. However, they are not necessary or sufficient to make a diagnosis of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Cognitive and behavioral problems are frequent in patients with epilepsy. Epilepsy is frequent in patients with developmental delay. In general,
 you should not change your behavioral medications because the patient has epilepsy or is on antiseizure medications. However, if you have a concern
 that the patient is doing worse than before, check with your pediatric neurologist if the antiseizure medications (especially phenobarbital,
 topiramate, or levetiracetam) are negatively influencing cognition or behavior in your patient.</b></p>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Epileptiform discharges can cause regression. If you think your patient is regressing, consult the pediatric neurologist. There are many causes of regression
 and generally none of them is good. A child with regression should always be evaluated by the pediatric neurologist.</b></p>
