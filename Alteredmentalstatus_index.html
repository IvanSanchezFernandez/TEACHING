<h2 style="text-align: center">Increased intracranial pressure: more neuroanatomy</h2>
<p style="font-size:26px">The skull (once fontanelles close) is a rigid cavity. The total volume must remain constant. Therefore, if one of the three intracranial components (brain, blood, CSF) increases, one or the two other components must decrease. Causes of increased intracranial pressure include space occupying lesions (such as tumors) or hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is caused by either obstruction to the CSF flow (obstructive hydrocephalus) or increased CSF production (non-obstructive hydrocephalus). Initially, the intracranial components exhibit some compliance and are able to compensate for increases in volume without major increases in intracranial pressure (for example, by decreasing the amount of blood or CSF intracranially). However, after a certain point, minor increases in volume lead to abrupt increases in intracranial pressure. At that point, there is risk of brain herniation.</p>

<p style="font-size:26px">Typical signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure include vomiting, limitation of vertical movement (especially upgaze), unsteadiness, headache (especially if increases with straining and on squatting and wakes the patient up from sleep), and, of course, altered mental status. What happens before the fontanelles close? Any of the above can happen, but also there is another mechanism to tolerate the increase in intracranial pressure: increase in head size.<br><br>Macrocephaly can be a sign of increased intracranial pressure in an infant, especially when the increase in head circumference is subacute over weeks and the patient crosses several percentile lines in their growth curve. In these situations there are typically other signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure as described above. In contrast, when the patient smoothly follows a percentile line in their head circumference growth chart and there are no other concerning signs or symptoms, the patient most likely has familial macrocephaly or prominent subarachnoid spaces.</p>
